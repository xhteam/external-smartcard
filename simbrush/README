This project is originally by Fabio Casadei, Antonio Savoldi, and Paolo Gubian; see
https://sites.google.com/site/savolabs/Home/tools for the original location, and see
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.160.4644 for the paper
describing the tool in detail.

Note:  I could not find an explicit license anywhere in the sources or on the
web site, but "open source" is stated several times in the links above.
