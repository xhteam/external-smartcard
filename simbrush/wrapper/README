Wrapper modules:

The purpose of these scripts is to translate the raw data into an
intellegible form suitable for the forensics practitioner.

1) wrapper_simple.pl: This script translates all the standard data by
creating an xml file that can be viewed in any web browser.

usage => "perl wrapper_simple.pl file_in.xml"

The output file will be "file_in.out.xml"


2) wrapper_dom.pl: This script translates all data (standard and
non-standard). For the latter only the header is translated, as the
coding is unknown for non-standard elementary files.

usage => "perl wrapper_dom.pl file_in.xml"

As output it will create "file_in.out.xml", representing the
translation according with the DOM (Document Object Model) standard,
and "fat_file_in.txt", representing the "File Allocation Table"
related to the SIM/USIM card.
